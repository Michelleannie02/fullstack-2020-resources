# fullstack-2020-resources

## Usage
Use this repo to collect and structure resources from
- information from lectures
- external resources
- related material and references
- anything else you think your classmates might find valuable

## Collaboration
You are free to collaborate and structure resources in any way you want but keep in mind that you have to do it together and think of this as an exercise to build a valuable resource for everyone in the class. 

### Suggesting resources and structure
- Please use issues and pull requests using the [project](https://github.com/bjornwann/fullstack-2020-resources/projects/1) when you submit them so you can track them in the project. 
- Have at least one person to review your pull requests (preferably not bjornwann)
- Structure resources in markdown files and try to have different files for different subjects, however this structure might have to change during the process so try to not do too many changes in a single commit
- use branches for larger structural changes and have several people review them before commiting
- TIP: clone the repo and branch it and use VS-code to do larger commits to several files

### Before you start
- Think of this as an exercise to use GitHub and don't be afraid to break things. Help each other and use this opportunity to try things out in a collaborative way. 
- Remember that this is a public repo and everyone who has the link can see it. 
- Don't publish contact information to other students or copyrighted material
